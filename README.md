# kmeans_implementation

This project contains two implementations of kmeans clustering.
1. Basic Implemenattion
2. Using Scikit-learn

Basic implementation uses numpy and pandas to create the algorithm from scratch, whereas the scikit-learn implementation uses scikit-learn library.

The dataset used is **iris**

Here is the final visualization of data when clustered (fo 3 clusters).

Further, a comparison is made to find the optimal number of clusters using elbow method

note: This implementation based on information from [codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/pro/intensive/machine-learning-fundamentals) 's lectures.
